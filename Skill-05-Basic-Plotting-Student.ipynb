    "# Object-Oriented Plotting\n",
    "To make a minimally satisfactory plot, you need axis labels, and to change the plot from a line to points. These and many other plot features are easier to do with an *object oriented* approach. Object oriented means you create an object, then call that object's methods to modify it.\n",

    "Run by itself, you will not see anything happen.\n",

Data should almost always be plotted with dots or symbols. `matplotlib`, like `Matlab`, dies this with a formatting parameterin the `plot` command. You can append and optional third parameter after the y array with formatting information about the plot line. This formatting is a very compact string with the line type, the symbol, and the color encoded in a three character string. Here are some examples:\n",
    "* `'-k'` - plots only a black line. (`k` means blac***k***.)\n",
    "* `'.r'` - plots only dots in the color red\n",
    "* `'--g'` - plots only a green dashed line\n",
    "* `'ob'` - plots only circles in blue\n",
