    "# Writing Data to Files\n",

    "A file format I strongly recommend is a Comma Separate Value (CSV) file with comment lines begining with a pound sign, `#`. This file format is common and it can be opened and read by Microsoft Excel and LibreOffice Calc programs. Many other program produce and accept this format. Here is what it might look like for our little time and position data set.\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Data from run 1\n",
    "# 2015-01-06 20:53\n",
    "# This is a final comment\n",

    "5.000,11.000,50.000\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that you should include meaningful comments about the data **in the data file itself**! Here are ProfHuster's words of wisdom (actually requirements) for data file comments.\n",
    "1. You should alway include the date and time the data was created in a comment.\n",
    "2. You should have a comment right before the first data point with a brief column label including units.\n",
    "3. You should have at least one comment describing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also strongly recommend that the *name* of the data file contain at least the data and a sequence number. For example I am going to create a data file named `2017-01-07-Run1.csv`. If you write start the file name with the date in this format `YYYY-MM-DD`, then when the files are in alphabetical order, the are also in chronological order. When you are working on an experiment over several weeks this is a huge help!"

    "You are almost there. Next you need to know how to put commas as the delimiter (the character that separates the number in a line) in the file. \n",

The function `savetxt` has a default delimiter of a space, \" \". Since you want a comma, after the filename and the array, include `delimiter=','`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When `savetxt` writes out arrays of floats, it write 18 significant figures for each number. This makes the file hard to read. If you know about how many significant figures your data has, you can supply a *format* for your data. For this example, two decimal places are fine. The format for this in python is `%.2f`. The `%` starts the format statement, the `f` makes it a floating point formatted output, and `.2` says format the data with two decimal places. You need another keyword argument to the function `savetxt` that looks like this: `fmt='%.3f'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you have to give lines of comments at the beginning of you file. The function `savetxt` conveniently has this feature with the keyword argument `header=`. You do not have to start the header lines with the comment character `#` because that is the default character `savetxt` adds to the lines in the header. Since you want more than one comment line in your header, the easy way is to define a string variable with several lines of comments in it. This is easy to do with the triple quote.
