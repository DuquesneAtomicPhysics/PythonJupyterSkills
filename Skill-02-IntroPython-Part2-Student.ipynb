    "# Introduction to Python, Part 2\n",
    "This skill homework shows a few extensions to the previous homework on variables, lists, and functions, then covers some completely new territory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More on Operators\n",
    "Python, of course, has the traditional mathematical operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The one important note is that division with integers (since we are using python 3)\n",
    "will always give a float. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below try some integer division like\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(33/33)\n",
    "print(33/2)\n",
    "print(33/2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Mathematical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three additional math operators you should know.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder operator, `%`, does a division and returns the remainder. It works with both integer and float division. Try the following remainders:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(255 % 16)\n",
    "print(4.2%1.5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next the power operator is `**`. (*Many languages use the `^`, but in python this is the bitwise XOR operator, so be careful!*) It raises the first number to the power of the second. If both operators are integers, it will return an integer if possible. Try the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(2**3)\n",
    "print(3**2)\n",
    "print(2**(-1))\n",
    "print(1.2**1.2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Note: I usually do not put spaces around the power operator because it has higher precedence than the other mathematical operators.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the *integer division* or *floor division* operator is `//`. This acts like normal integer division if the operators are integers. The odd feature is that the answer is rounded *down*, even if the answer is negative. If either or both of the operands are floats, the answer will be a float round down. Try the following floor divisions:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(3//2)\n",
    "print(-3//2)\n",
    "print(100.0//3.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the results to make sure you understand how these operators work."

    "## Compound Assignments Like `+=`\n",
    "Like `C` and most modern languages, python supports *compound assignments*. These are statements that modify the current value of a variable by performing an operation on it. They are equivalent to assigning the result of an operation to the first operand:\n",
    "\n",
    "The following pairs of statements have the same result:\n",
    "\n",
    "`y += x` or `y = y + x`\n",
    "\n",
    "even\n",
    "\n",
    "`price *= units + 1` is the same as `price = price * (units+1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code cell below, create some variables and try compound assignments on them. Here are my suggestions, but feel free to try your own.\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 2\n",
    "y  = 3\n",
    "y += x\n",
    "x *= 1.6\n",
    "y += x\n",
