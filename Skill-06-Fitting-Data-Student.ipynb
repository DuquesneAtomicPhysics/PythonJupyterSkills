    "A very important data analysis skill is fitting a model to your data. Let's set up the situation with the data we simulated above. You have measured the output voltage from a system and it is delayed by some amount from your input signal which has the form $V(t) = 1.0 \\sin(2 \\pi t)$. You want to know the amplitude of the output and the time delay.\n",

We are going to treat it as a black box, but what it does is minimize the average vertical distance between each data point and the closest vertical point on the model function. This module is in the `optimize` module which in turn is in the module `scipy`. \n",

Let's call the amplitude `amp` and the start time `t0`, so the model function we are fitting is $V_{out} = amp \\sin(2 \\pi (t - t_0))$. The module `curve_fit` needs a function with independent variable as the first parameter. The next parameters, howevermany there are, are parameters to your fitting function.\n",
