To switch back to the formatted documentation press `<shift><enter>`. Documentation cells can also typeset mathematical equations in line like $r = \\pi$, or on their own lines like\n",

    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "Python is a general programming language that is widely used in scientific computing. It is open source, free, and available on many different types of computers including supercomputers, Windows and Mac personal computers, to tiny single chip micro processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, please note: this notebook will not teach you basic programming. Instead, we assume you already know at least a little bit about:\n",
    "* variables,\n",
    "* loops,\n",
    "* conditionals (i.e., `if` and `else`),\n",
    "* lists or arrays, and\n",

    "# Variables\n",
    "A name that is used to denote something or a value is called a *variable*. Python is not a strongly typed language and variables are not declared before being used. The following examples create four variables, an integer, two floats, and a string.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You should also note that I strongly encourage the use of longer variable names that are descriptive. Years of experience have taught me that it is very hard to understand or debug code where all the variables have names like `x` and `i`. (The one exception I make is if I have a simple loop I will use a single letter for the loop variable.)\n",

This allows you to save time and possible spelling mistakes by typing the beginning of a name, then pressing the `<tab>` key and the name will automagically complete. If the name is not unique, a list of possibilities pops up. You can either keep typing or use the up and down arrow keys, then press the `<enter>` key to pick the right name. After you type in your lists, try typing `pri<tab>` and `print` will complete for you. Then try typing the first couple of letters of your variable name and tab completing that, too."

    "Once you have a list, you can access its members in different ways by *indexing* and *slicing*. Indexing a list is just picking one item out. Python, like most other programming languages, starts indexing with `0` and the index of the last item in a list of `N` items is number `N-1`. The syntax of indexing is the name of the list with the index in square brackets, so the second item of the first list above is `names[1]`. You can print an item, use it in a math calculation, or anything you could do with a single values variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Slicing a List\n",
    "A *slice* of a list is a way of pulling out a sublist. The syntax for this is `list[start:end+1]` where `start` is the first item in the sublist, and `end` is the last. Note the second number in the slice is the ending index plus one. You can even use slices with negative indexing mentioned above.\n",

For example, you can print a greeting for each name in the list `names`. This code would do that:\n",
